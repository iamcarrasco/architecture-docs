# Save Flow & Status Badges

This guide explains save modes, PR workflow, and what each status means.

## Save flow

### Draft and review
- Draft changes are saved to a draft branch
- PRs can be opened for review
- Review status indicates a PR is open

### Approved
- Approved status commits directly to main
- This is the only status that immediately updates Fumadocs

## Status meaning

- **Draft**: Work in progress, not ready for review
- **In Review**: PR is open and awaiting feedback
- **Approved**: Merged or committed to main
- **Decommissioned**: Deprecated content

## Badges on the docs page
- Badges are derived from the `status` frontmatter field
- Only one status is stored in frontmatter

## Best practices
- Keep draft status while iterating
- Switch to review when sharing
- Set approved only when final

## Troubleshooting
- If you don’t see changes in Fumadocs, confirm you committed to main
- If a page won’t render, check for MDX errors or merge markers
